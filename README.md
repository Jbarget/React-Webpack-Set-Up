# React-Webpack-Set-Up
Simple set up including hot reloading for a React web app

## How to work it!

### Developing

in your command line run ```npm run dev```

This will build your react app for development, serve it up at localhost:8080/public, open that link in the browser and reload (holding state) as you develop.

Super cool eh?

Note remember to rebuild for production.

####Build

in your command line run ```npm run build```

to build you static files, not this script will also open up your index.html file in your browser
