# React-Webpack-Set-Up
Simple set up including hot reloading for a React web app. Allows for es2015 and react presets in the .babelrc so es6 away!

## How to work it!

### Developing

in your command line run ```npm run dev```

This will build your react app for development and run a development sever on port 8080. Visit localhost:8080/public, in the browser and watch the app reload (holding state) as you develop.

Super cool eh?

Note remember to rebuild for production.

####Build

in your command line run ```npm run build```

to build you static files in the public folder. Open your index.html file in your browser to see your react app in action.
